# Pollution-Impact-Asthmatic-Patients-ANOVA-Prediction

The purpose of this report is to foster the curiosity of how pollution a!ects the health of people in California. The California O"ce of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) dataset includes levels of certain pollutants prevalent in the state, as well as #gures of diseases commonly associated with pollution. Few such pollutants include pm2.5, diesel emission, and toxic release, with this study analyzing the e!ects on asthma. With a series of tests, we determine that the level of pollutants can signi#cantly predict the log number of asthmatic people in California, as well as the idea that the log spread of asthmatic people throughout California is signi#cantly di!erent.
